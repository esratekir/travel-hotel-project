        <p><strong>Interpretation of Tourguidefind host</strong></p>
        <p>On Tourguidefind, a ‘host’ is a broad definition of a person who resides in a certain location and wishes to share his personal local experience with travellers he meets on Tourguidefind so that they could become acquainted with the area from the perspective of a local. Tourguidefind local hosts must meet all legal requirements to give tours in their area. In some cases, and in some locations, this means that a specific license has to be obtained from an appropriate authority. However if a Tourguidefind host is simply accompanying travellers, offers practical advice or shares his experience about ‘best bars and restaurants’, ‘non-touristic spots’, ‘shopping areas’ etc. he may just be a passionate local person without any formal training in tour organising.</p>

Based on the Profiles, the Visitors may select the Locals to provide the Guidance.</p>

        <p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>

You undertake to keep your Registration Data accurate and current and thus update your Registration Data when relevant.</p>

Keep your username and password secure and do not allow anyone else to use them to access the Services. Traveler is not responsible for any loss that results from unauthorized use of your username and password, with or without your knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong>Age Restrictions</strong></p>
        <p>The Site, Application and Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. Any access to or use of the Site, Application or Services by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site, Application or Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.</p>
        <p><strong>Requirements for the Locals, Profiles and Guidance</strong></p>
        <p>If you are Visitor, you understand and agree that a Local is not an individual involved in professional travel activities. A Local is not always a licensed and/or qualified tour guide. He or she is a person, who resides and has knowledge of certain area and wishes to share it with the Visitors so that they become acquainted with the area from the perspective of a Local.</p>
        <p>As a Local, you may create Profile where you can showcase a range of original local Guidance as well as personal information you wish to share with Visitors about you and your area. The Profile will be made publicly available via the Services, and Visitors will be able to book Guidance via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Profile. Visitors will also be able to provide feedback on your Guidance and rate you as a Local. We will monitor all feedback obtained from Visitors prior to publishing any reviews on your Profile, however we cannot be held liable for any derogatory or negative feedback received from Visitors.</p>
        <p>If you are Local, you represent and warrant that your Profile and Guidance (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, (ii) will be in compliance with all applicable laws, tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply, and (iii) will not conflict with the rights of third parties.</p>
        <p>Please also note that any Guidance offered by a Local must comply with the following requirements: (i) the Guidance has to be delivered personally by the Local who confirmed the booking, (ii) the Visitor may not be joined to the Guidance booked by or delivered to other Visitors, (iii) the number of the Guidances that the Local may deliver per day is limited to one.</p>
        <p><strong>User Interaction and Conduct</strong></p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users, whether online or in person. Traveler assumes no responsibility or liability for any loss or damage resulting from any interaction with other Users of the Services. You agree to take reasonable precautions in all interactions with other Users, and conduct any necessary investigation before meeting another person. Traveler Limited is under no obligation to become involved in any disputes between Users, but may do so at its own discretion.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to monitor and suspend any User accounts we suspect of abusing.</p>
        <p>Sharing your contact details, such as your phone numbers, emails, links to other sites and social networks, is not allowed before a booking is confirmed and paid. Communication before booking is for discussing your tour details only. Contact details of both parties will be automatically released after booking is confirmed via Traveler payment system. In case you bypass the Traveler platform, you isolate yourself from safe payments, customer support in case of dispute, refund policies and trustful reputation through our review system. Any attempts to exchange contacts before booking or execute transactions outside of the website can also be a reason for limiting you from using our services. If necessary, your internal communication on Traveler can be reviewed by Tourguidefind staff. This is to provide you a better support should a conflict arise that requires escalation between you and another user.</p>
        <p>You agree not to use the Services (i) to post or transmit any material which is or may be infringing on intellectual property rights of others, harassing, threatening, false, misleading, inflammatory, libellous, an invasion of privacy or disclosure of private information, obscene, pornographic, abusive, discriminating, illegal or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offence, violate the rights of any party or in other ways may give rise to civil liability or non-compliance with any relevant laws of your local jurisdiction, (ii) to sell, promote, or advertise any product or service other than Guidance, (iii) to advertise sexual services, (iv) to advertise or promote any illegal product or service, and (v) to promote any political, ethnic, racial or religious organisation or belief.</p>
        <p>When using the Site, Application and our Services you shall not (i) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs, (ii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Site or Application or the data contained therein, or our servers or networks, (iii) attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Site or Application or its related systems or networks or to any other computer system or website, or (iv) take any action that imposes an unreasonably or disproportionately large load on our system.</p>

        <p><strong>Bookings</strong></p>
        <p>If you are a Visitor and wish to book the Guidance, you may do so either through the Site or Application.</p>
        <p>If you are a Local and a booking is requested for your Guidance through the Site or Application, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking before the day of when the booking is requested. Otherwise the booking request will be automatically cancelled.</p>
        <p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
        <p>A Local individually determines the Guidance Fee.</p>
        <p>Before setting the Guidance Fee the Local must evaluate the fees and any local taxes applied for providing Guidance services. The Guidance Fee has to include any such fees and taxes that the Local determines that he/she has to collect.
